# polynomial state across the stack

an explainer, not a spec. written on 2026-03-23 to argue the decision to commit the whole graph to one polynomial ([[bbg]]) opened through [[lens]], and to follow that decision through the three pillars of the [[trinity]] thesis. the decision was taken and shipped; the projections below are kept whole because a projection with a named assumption is worth more than its absence, and each is marked by what the code has done with it since.

status of the projections, 2026-09-24:

- measured and confirmed: proof size 1–2 KB (zheng universal step CCS, 2026-09-09); tri-kernel convergence fits a zheng circuit because graph reads are field operations; Brakedown is hash-based over hemera, so the post-quantum floor is unchanged.
- measured and refuted as stated: per-ticket decide/verify is 9–19 ms, not tens of microseconds (foculus/audit/ticket-proof-cost.md); the constant-size recursive step over Brakedown is blocked until the tensor-Merkle binding is proven (lens issue #6).
- open, no code yet: TFHE bootstrap in polynomial state, MPC over polynomial evaluations, provable VQE and quantum-walk acceleration, gravity-weighted verification. these are the speculation this page exists to keep.

the program-level half, what the Trinity program itself does and how it is verified, lives with [[trident]] in `docs/explanation/trinity-bench.md`.

## the cascade

### Quantum pillar

trinity promises: hash-based everything, post-quantum from genesis.

the concern: polynomial commitments add a computational assumption. NMT completeness is structural (information-theoretic). Lens completeness is computational (collision-resistance).

the resolution: Brakedown is a hash-based lens. its soundness relies on [[Hemera]] collision resistance — the SAME hash that NMT nodes use. the trust root is identical. polynomial state does not weaken the quantum pillar because the polynomial is committed via hashes, not pairings or discrete log.

what polynomial state ADDS to quantum:

- quantum circuit simulation provable in-circuit. a quantum gate is a matrix over F_{p²}. the state vector is a polynomial evaluation. with polynomial state, the prover reads the quantum state via Lens opening (O(1) field ops), applies the gate, writes the result — all inside a [[zheng]] proof. NMT would require O(log n) hemera hashes per state read — prohibitive for million-qubit simulation
- [[VQE]] and QAOA optimization loops become provable end-to-end. the variational optimizer reads parameters from polynomial state, computes energy expectation, updates parameters — all in one recursive proof
- quantum error correction codes can be verified algebraically. stabilizer measurements are polynomial evaluations — same structure as state queries

quantum advantage NOW depends on algebraic state. without it: quantum simulation reads cost O(log n) hemera each, limiting simulations to ~1000 qubits in-circuit. with it: reads cost O(1) field ops, enabling million-qubit simulations in zheng capacity.

### Privacy pillar

trinity promises: ZK + FHE + MPC trilateral.

the concern: does polynomial state affect privacy? individual [[cyberlinks]] are private (mutator set). public state is aggregate (axons, neuron summaries).

the resolution: polynomial state preserves the privacy boundary exactly. private records (cyberlinks, spent, balance) use the mutator set polynomial ([[mutator-set-polynomial]]). public records (particles, axons, neurons) use the unified polynomial. the two polynomials are separate commitments — private data never enters the public polynomial.

what polynomial state ADDS to privacy:

- TFHE bootstrapping IN polynomial state. the bootstrap key is a polynomial evaluation. key switching reads polynomial state. with [[goldilocks-fhe]] (q = p), the entire FHE bootstrap is field-native AND reads state via O(1) Lens openings. NMT reads would add O(log n) hemera per key element — at 1024 key elements, that is 32,768 hemera calls vs 1,024 field ops. 32× cheaper bootstrapping

- private state transitions (tier 1-3) produce zheng proofs that reference polynomial state. the proof says "I correctly updated the mutator set given these polynomial state reads." verifier checks ONE polynomial opening per state read instead of ONE NMT path. proof size: ~200 bytes per state read instead of ~1 KiB. private transactions become 5× lighter

- MPC secret sharing over polynomial evaluations. Shamir shares are polynomial evaluations by definition. the state IS a polynomial. MPC threshold operations become structurally aligned — the MPC shares and the state representation share the same mathematical object

### AI pillar

trinity promises: field-native neural networks, provable inference.

the concern: polynomial state adds complexity to the prover. does this slow down AI inference?

the resolution: the opposite. polynomial state makes AI faster and more capable.

what polynomial state ADDS to AI:

- the compiled [[transformer]] ([[bostrom/compiled model]]) reads graph topology via Lens openings. embedding lookup = polynomial evaluation. attention weights = polynomial openings at dialect-typed dimensions. with NMT: embedding lookup costs O(log n) hemera per particle. with polynomial state: O(1) field ops per particle. for 2.9M particles: 96M hemera calls → 2.9M field ops

- tri-kernel convergence (the AI core of [[foculus]]) fits in zheng circuit at 33% capacity BECAUSE graph reads are algebraic. without polynomial state: 15× over capacity → AI cannot prove its own consensus. with polynomial state: the network's intelligence (φ*) is self-proving

- neural network weights can be committed as polynomial evaluations. a model with 155M parameters = polynomial of degree 155M. inference = evaluate the weight polynomial at layer/position coordinates. provable inference: prove the evaluation was correct. no need to commit each weight separately — ONE commitment for the entire model

- gravity-weighted verification: not all particles deserve equal verification effort. gravity-commitment ([[gravity-commitment]]) scales verification cost ∝ φ* (importance). polynomial state enables this naturally — evaluate the importance polynomial first (O(1)), then decide verification depth. NMT would require reading importance first via O(log n) path

## the intersections strengthen

### Quantum × Privacy (with polynomial state)

post-quantum FHE bootstrapping with O(1) state reads. quantum key distribution keys stored as polynomial evaluations — threshold-reconstructible via Shamir (which IS polynomial evaluation). the quantum-private intersection becomes algebraically native: quantum states, FHE ciphertexts, and MPC shares are all polynomials over the same field, committed the same way.

### Quantum × AI (with polynomial state)

quantum-accelerated tri-kernel. quantum walks on the [[cybergraph]] achieve quadratic speedup for focus convergence. the quantum walk operator reads the adjacency as polynomial evaluations — O(1) per edge. provable quantum walks: the walk is a nox program, proven by zheng, reading state via polynomial. the proof attests "this quantum walk on this graph produced this focus distribution."

### Privacy × AI (with polynomial state)

private model inference on polynomial state. the model weights are a polynomial commitment. the input data is FHE-encrypted. the inference reads weights via Lens opening (private — the verifier sees the opening proof but not the weights). the output is a focus update (Δφ*) that enters the public polynomial. privacy-preserving AI that updates collective intelligence — made algebraically efficient by polynomial state.

### Quantum × Privacy × AI (full trinity, with polynomial state)

encrypted quantum neural inference over polynomial state. the scenario from the trinity thesis — diagnostic AI on FHE-encrypted medical data with quantum acceleration — becomes:

1. patient data: FHE-encrypted polynomial evaluations (privacy)
2. model: polynomial commitment of weights (AI)
3. quantum layer: VQE over F_{p²} reading polynomial state (quantum advantage)
4. proof: zheng proof of correct inference (all three)
5. verification: ONE polynomial opening + ONE zheng verify = 50 μs (all three)

without polynomial state: each of these steps requires NMT reads. NMT reads dominate the circuit. the full trinity scenario overflows zheng capacity.

with polynomial state: reads are O(1). the full trinity fits in a single proof.

## the four primitives, revisited

the [[trinity]] thesis identifies four hardware primitives: fma, ntt, p2r (Poseidon2 round), lut.

polynomial state shifts the balance:

| primitive | NMT architecture | polynomial architecture | change |
|---|---|---|---|
| fma | SpMV for tri-kernel, AI inference | SpMV + polynomial evaluation + lens | MORE — fma becomes dominant |
| ntt | proof commitment (Brakedown) | proof commitment + polynomial updates + FHE bootstrap | MORE — ntt handles state too |
| p2r | EVERYTHING: state reads, commitments, Fiat-Shamir | Fiat-Shamir + signal identity (NOT state reads) | LESS — freed from state duty |
| lut | activations, S-box, bootstrap | same | unchanged |

the critical shift: Hemera (p2r) is released from state authentication duty. currently, hemera does double duty — hashing for state (NMT paths) AND hashing for proofs (Fiat-Shamir + Merkle). polynomial state removes the first duty. hemera focuses on what it does uniquely: proof-internal hashing.

this matters for the [[Goldilocks field processor]]: the GFP chip can allocate p2r units to proof throughput instead of state reads. same silicon, more proofs per second.

## quantitative impact on trinity test

the trinity test (from [[trinity]]): can the system simultaneously achieve quantum security, full privacy, and AI-native intelligence?

| metric | NMT architecture | polynomial architecture | what changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| post-quantum | yes (hash-based) | yes (same hash-based lens) | unchanged |
| per-cyberlink constraints | ~106K | ~3K | 33× cheaper participation |
| FHE bootstrap in-circuit | prohibitive (hemera reads) | feasible (field reads) | privacy tier 2-3 enabled |
| provable consensus | impossible (15× over capacity) | 33% capacity | AI becomes self-proving |
| full trinity scenario | overflows zheng | fits in one proof | complete unification achieved |
| light client verification | ~1 KiB per namespace | ~200 bytes | 5× lighter |
| proof size | 157 KiB | 1-5 KiB | 30-150× smaller |
| recursive step | 70K constraints | 30 field ops | 2,300× cheaper recursion |

the polynomial decision does not change WHAT trinity promises. it changes WHETHER trinity is achievable. with NMT: each pillar works independently but the intersections overflow proof capacity. with polynomial state: the intersections fit, and the full trinity — quantum × privacy × AI in one proof — becomes concrete.

## the dependency

```
polynomial state (algebraic-nmt + unified-polynomial-state)
  enables:
    → provable consensus (AI pillar: self-proving intelligence)
    → efficient FHE bootstrap (privacy pillar: tier 2-3 practical)
    → quantum simulation at scale (quantum pillar: million-qubit provable)
    → full trinity in one proof (all three pillars unified)
    → GFP chip optimization (p2r freed for proof throughput)
```

this is why algebraic state commitments are game-changing. they do not add a capability. they remove a bottleneck that prevents all three pillars from combining.
